To add a test suite, copy 'tests-template.js', rename it to '*-tests.js' and write your test in it.
Every suite should export a 'stats' object returned from the runTests function (as in the template).

To run tests in a test suite, simply run it with Node, e.g. "node framework-tests.js".
To run all test suites, run type "node runAllTests.js".
